title: 'Account creation'
---

Cronfig is a micro service living in other server than yours. You have to create an account in the service so the service knows it's you who is viewing/creaing/modifying your tasks. The account is as minimal as it can be. All you need is an email address. That's it. Here is how the workflow of creating a new account looks like:

1. Install the plugin into your system (Mautic probably).
2. The first page you'll see is **register**/remind/login page.
3. Fill in your **email address** to register a new account, hit submit.
4. You'll receive an email with your **API key** and account delete link (documented bellow)
5. Fill in your API key to the login field, hit submit.
6. While logged in, create the jobs you need and/or see how the past jobs are doing.
