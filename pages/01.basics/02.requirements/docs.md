## For Mautic plugin

- Mautic instance (version 2.x.x) on a publicly accessible URL. Cronfig won't be able to trigger jobs on your localhost or intranet.
- You will need access to the server file system so you could upload the plugin files.
- The plugin itself doesn't need any special server configuration. If your Mautic runs OK, the plugin will too.
- Modern browser.
